# Teleport Limits

![](https://github.com/Azure-Lazuline/teleport-limits/blob/main/screenshots/screenshot.jpg?raw=true)

Puts a cooldown on your map teleport. It defaults to 30 minutes but you can change it higher or lower. Teleporting to player-owned housing is always free.

> *"why would anyone want that?"*

- if you're always teleporting exactly where you need to go, the world risks feeling like a bunch of disconnected rooms instead of a huge physical location.
- there's interesting routing decisions to be made regarding how to best get from one area to another, including CrossCentral and the Sky Rail, which just never get used normally.
- it gives you more reasons to pass through areas you'd ignore, and possibly find secrets you missed.
- it feels more lore-compliant, since everyone *else* is always running on foot everywhere. It's important for MMOs to have emergent reasons for you to encounter other players, and travel is one of the most common places for that to happen.
- and most importantly, sometimes it's just nice to take things slower instead of always rushing the next objective.

### Options

The options menu ingame has settings for the mod, under the "General" tab.

- **Teleport Cooldown**: 0/15/30/60/90 minutes
- **Only At Landmarks**: allow teleports only if you're already at a landmark. (This overrides the NG+ option for that, and is implemented a little bit nicer.)

### Installation

To use, install [ccloader](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCLoader), and go to the "Mods" menu ingame (the button at the *top* of the Options menu, not the tab on the right) and it should be listed there to select and install.

You can also install manually by placing [the .ccmod file](https://github.com/Azure-Lazuline/teleport-limits/releases) in your ccloader mods folder.
